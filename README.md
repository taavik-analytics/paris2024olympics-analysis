<h1>Paris 2024: Analysis of Olympic Medalists - Performance, Attributes, and Backgrounds"</h1>

This analysis uses data from two sources: athletes.csv and medallists.csv, both from Kaggle. The datasets were combined to show all athlete performances, including medals, sports and personal details. The data was cleaned up and despite some errors, the analysis proceeded with the assumption that the data was accurate.

The analysis looked at how many medals each country won in different sports. It looked at the average height and weight of medalists by gender. It also looked at the education of medalists, finding those with degrees. The study also looked at athletes with relatives in sports to see if family influences success. It also looked at the age of medalists to see if there are common age groups.

The results show the best countries and tell us about the physical and educational backgrounds of successful athletes. The analysis also looked at how family and age affect success in sports. Despite some data quality issues, this study offers valuable insights into competitive sports.
